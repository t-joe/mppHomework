inside removeDuplicates function when comparing employees,
if hashmap is already containing the employee object then the code changes the property "visited" to true.
which changes the state of object and treated as different object.

for example
	"Joe" 100 false
	"Joe" 100 true 

are different objects.
so same object could added more than once.
