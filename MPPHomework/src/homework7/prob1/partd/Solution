inside removeDuplicates function when comparing employees,
if hashmap is already containing the employee object then the code changes the property "visited" to true.
which changes the state of object and treated as different object. next time it compares against another object result will probably be false
so it adds to list.

for example
	"Joe" 100 false
	"Joe" 100 true 

are different objects.
so same object could added more than once.

Solution should be either making Employee class Immutable or just taking out setVisited part from code.
